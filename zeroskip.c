/* zeroskip.c - append-only ordered key-value store
 *
 * A directory of immutable and append-only files, with lock-free readers and a
 * single writer.  The design rests on one invariant, without exception:
 * nothing is ever written except by appending to a file or by creating a new
 * file.  No file is ever modified in place or truncated, and there is no
 * mutable object of any kind - no manifest, no shared cache.
 *
 * The format and protocol are specified in
 * doc/specification.md.  Requirement labels in
 * the comments below (F-n format, D-n database, C-n concurrency, R-n recovery,
 * A-n API, G-n guarantee) cite that document, and doc/conformance.md maps each
 * to the test that enforces it.
 *
 * Sections appear in dependency order: each may only call downwards into those
 * above it.

 *
 * Written out rather than delegating to the C library, per F-11a.  Being precise
 * about why, because the folklore version of this warning is wrong and leads
 * people to "fix" the wrong thing:
 *
 *   - memcmp is defined to compare as unsigned char, so using it for the common
 *     prefix would in fact be correct.  What it does not do is order keys of
 *     differing length -- that is half of this function's job -- and its return
 *     magnitude is unspecified, so only its sign may be used.  A comparator that
 *     is just `return memcmp(a, b, min(alen, blen));` is broken for a key and
 *     its own prefix, which is the case T-2c leads with.
 *   - the platform hazard is comparing plain `char` directly, whose signedness
 *     varies: that orders keys above 0x7F differently on ARM than on x86 and
 *     produces pointer sections the other platform cannot read.  Hence the
 *     explicit unsigned char pointers below.
 *
 * The signedness failure is silent and survives every test that uses ASCII keys,
 * which is why T-2c's table includes 0x7F against 0x80.  A memcmp-plus-length
 * variant is not detectably different from this loop, so no test enforces the
 * loop itself -- only the ordering it produces. */
